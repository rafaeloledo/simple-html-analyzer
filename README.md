# ‚ö°Ô∏è Requirements

A machine running Linux, Windows or macOS.

If you're on a portable device, it may be possible to run with `termux`.
You can contribute for more details on it if desired.

If you're on `Ubuntu` Linux Distribution, you can use `apt install <package-name>`.

On NixOS, BSD or any other distro, you may `handle it yourself`.

# ü™ì Usage Without GNU Make

> [!WARNING]
> You'll need to run manually

Compiling
```sh
$ javac HTMLAnalyzer.java
```

Running default example:
```sh
$ java HTMLAnalyzer http://hiring.axreng.com/internship/example1.html
```

Running local examples:
```sh
$ java HTMLAnalyzer example.html

# optionally
$ java HTMLAnalyzer example[2,3,4,5,6,7].html
```

Keep track that `example1.html` is reserved for the default example.
In `Makefile` `download/page/html:` target, it fetches for it with `wget` just for printing the content in a `handy way`.

In the `run:` target, the program normally fetches for the web content and stores it as Java Objects in memory, following the `Challenge Specification`.
